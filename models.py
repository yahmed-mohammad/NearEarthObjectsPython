"""Represent models for near-Earth objects and their close approaches.

The `NearEarthObject` class represents a near-Earth object. Each has a unique
primary designation, an optional unique name, an optional diameter, and a flag
for whether the object is potentially hazardous.

The `CloseApproach` class represents a close approach to Earth by an NEO. Each
has an approach datetime, a nominal approach distance, and a relative approach
velocity.

A `NearEarthObject` maintains a collection of its close approaches, and a
`CloseApproach` maintains a reference to its NEO.

The functions that construct these objects use information extracted from the
data files from NASA, so these objects should be able to handle all the
quirks of the data set, such as missing names and unknown diameters.
